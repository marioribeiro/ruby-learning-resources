## Interview questions you may expect for a Ruby development role

- Describe the structure of a unit test.
- Discuss good and bad examples of test descriptions
- Explain how do you use Bundler to manage Ruby gems.
- Explain how Ruby gems help reuse code across projects.
- Explain RSpec file and folders naming conventions.
- Explain the structure of a Gemfile.
- Explain what a stack trace is
- Explain what RVM is and how you use it.
- Explain what test-driven development is and what its advantages are.
- Explain when you would use Extract Class refactoring pattern and how you would do it.
- How can you access instance variable outside the instance they belong to?
- How can you check an expression raises an error with RSpec? Why do you have to pass the code as a block to do this?
- Tell me about arrays and hashes in Ruby? When would you use them? When would you prefer one to the other and why?
- What are constants and how are they different from variables? Why use them?
- What are exceptions in Ruby? Why do they have messages associated with them?

- What file name conventions Ruby classes use? What happens if the class name is in CamelCase?
- What is a Ruby class? What is an instance of a class?
- What is an edge case in software engineering? How do you validate code behaviour when an edge case is encountered?
- What is refactoring?
- What is the nil value in Ruby? How can you check a variable is nil? What happens if nil is used in a conditional expression (if/unless)?
- What is the red/green/refactor cycle? Give me an example of using it.
- What's a class constructor? What is the initialize method? How are they different?
- When do you have to use a return statement in Ruby and when can you omit it?
- When do you refactor code? Why is it important to have good test coverage before refactoring?
- Why some Ruby methods end with a question mark? What are they expected to return?
- Why would you use curly braces to pass a block of code to the expect method in RSpec?
- Why would you want to temporarily disable some tests (make them pending)?
